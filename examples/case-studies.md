# Case Studies

## Case study 1 — Test generation at ACME Corp (hypothetical)
**Context:** Legacy monolith with low test coverage.  
**Intervention:** Introduce LLM-assisted test generation for core modules and integrate into CI.  
**Outcomes:** 40% increase in coverage on targeted modules, 25% reduction in manual test authoring time.  
**Lessons:** Human review required; flaky tests require guardrails; dataset quality matters.

## Case study 2 — CI triage automation
**Context:** High volume of flaky CI failures.  
**Intervention:** Auto-classify failures and propose immediate mitigations (re-run, cache clear).  
**Outcomes:** MTTR decreased by 15% on common failure classes.  
**Lessons:** Observability and labels are key; start with narrow failure classes.
