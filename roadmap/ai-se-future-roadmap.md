# AI in Software Engineering — Roadmap (3 Horizons)

## Horizon 1 — Near term (0-12 months)
- Pilot: Automated test generation for core modules
- Pilot: Contextual code suggestion as CI pull-request checks
- Deliverables: small prototype, success metrics, integration plan

## Horizon 2 — Mid term (12-24 months)
- Expand LLM agents with scoped automation (refactor suggestions, PR triage)
- Integrate AI into observability for anomaly detection and guided remediation
- Deliverables: robust integration, security review

## Horizon 3 — Long term (24+ months)
- Autonomous low-risk pipelines (self-healing for infra/config)
- Full lifecycle assistant: from requirements → tests → deploy pipelines
- Deliverables: governance model, auditability, strong human-in-the-loop mechanisms

## Prioritization framework
- Score each candidate by Impact * Feasibility * Risk-adjustment
- Start with high-impact, high-feasibility pilots; iterate with user feedback
